title: Mansplaining
---

What is mansplaining? Is it sexist? Can only men mansplain? "Mansplain" and
"mansplaining" have become much more common in discussions of both femnism and
online activism over the last few years. If you have ever been confused by these
terms or seen them as an attack on you, read on.

## Origins

The exact etymology of the term are a bit hard to trace. The most cited piece
when talking about origins is a [2008 op-ed by Rebecca Solnit](http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/13/opinion/op-solnit13).
This piece clearly outlines the underlying concepts and issues, however the first
actual use I could find is a [blog comment by phosfate](http://www.journalfen.net/community/fandom_wank/1156737.html?thread=179210113#t179210113)
a month after the op-ed was published. Given the context it is used, it sounds
like others understood her meaning, so I can only conjecture that it may have
been in use elsewhere prior to this, or potentially it was so clear that it
required no further explanation.

## Meaning

To summarize [several](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mansplaining)
[popular](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Splaining)
[definitions](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Mansplain):

    (v) To explain something in a demeaning or belittling fashion.

As shown above, this is commonly associated with a man speaking to a woman.

## Confusion

This leads to what I think is a source of consternation, "mansplaining" can
refer to two very different things. In one case you have the simple act of
talking down to someone while explaining something. In the other you have a
broad cultural standard that is acceptable or even encouraged for a member of a
privileged group to disrespect and dehumanize a member of a marginalized group
or even the group as a whole. The frustration is often compounded when the
explainer describes someones own maginalization to them, such a man explaining
sexism to a woman.

## Clarity

A number of people have suggested changing the term to avoid the gendered language.
[GeekFeminism has settled on splaining](http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Splaining),
and [reluctanthurricane has suggested downsplaining](http://reluctanthurricane.tumblr.com/post/7112530646/why-we-need-to-change-mansplain).
Both of these changes help show that the first form is an interaction between
two people and is about behavior, not social constructs.

The latter form is harder to clarify, it is often (but not exclusively) about
men abusing their positions of power and their own certainty of their
correctness, so reflecting this in the word itself seems important to me. As
with any discussion of cultural standards and norms, I ask fellow men to
appreciate that such a term is not an attack on *you*, it is a recognition of
broken culture that affects everyone regardless of gender.

## Can a woman mansplain?

Sometimes. An individual woman can be just as rude and obnoxious as any other
person, but if we call this (down)splaining then it would by definition not be
mansplaining. Most people belong to more than one group though, and a white
woman disparagingly explaining racism to a black man could certainly be seen
as mansplaining. In the end the answer is mostly up to your exact views and
can easily lead to miscommunications.

## Intersectionality bonus round

Allies for feminism come in all shapes and sizes, many of them on the male
side of the spectrum. As I've made clear, I think the concept of mansplaining is
important talk about, but there is a "but". Specifically, but care should be taken
to avoid reinforcing existing "us vs. them" mentalities. The use of gendered
language to refer to gendered things is not wrong, but it can put people on
the defensive. I hope this may serve to illuminate at least a few people, and
continued education will only improve things over time.
