<h2>Kubernetes<h2>
<p>
    You can find most of my Kubernetes work upstream in Kubernetes itself as well as many ecosystem projects. If you are looking for assistance with the Kubernetes community Slack, you can reach us in the #slack-admins channel.

    The Last Week In Kubernetes newsletter can be found at <a href="http://lwkd.info/">lwkd.info</a>.

<h2>Chef</h2>
<p>
    The majority of my Chef-related projects have been archived and are no longer under development, but you can find them for future reference under <a href="https://github.com/poise">github.com/poise</a>.
