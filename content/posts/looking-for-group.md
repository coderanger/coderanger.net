*Disclaimer: I will not respond to recruiters or staffing firms. If you are a
recruiter, please have the hiring manager contact me first.*

Way back in December of last year I ran a [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coderanger/delightful-application-deployment-with-chef) to fund a few weeks of
open source development time. Thanks to that campaign, some generous private
sponsors, and a bit of scope creep around the edges, I'm happy to say I'm finally
wrapping up the bulk of that work with a whole suite of new Chef cookbooks. With
that work winding down, I'm putting my hat back in the ring as a professional
ProgDevOpsCoderSecGineer!

# About Me ([Resume](/resume/))

* Toolsmith, teacher, troublemaker.
* Long-time Chef contributor and developer.
* Passionate about open-source, communities, ecosystems, quality.
* Full-stack, from kernel hacking to CSS.

Many of you probably know me as Coderanger. I've been involved in Chef and the
wider operations community for around five years now. I'm also part of the
Python Software Foundation operations team, and some of you may know me through
my role helping with PyCon US. I've been a developer for 8+ years now, across
fields as varied as MMORPG server architecture, mobile security engineering,
front-end design, and operations tooling. I've led teams both for companies and
as a volunteer, coordinating both a front-end development team to build the
new Chef web interface and the volunteer PSF operations group to keep
PyPI, Python.org and other community resources online.

For the last several years my focus has been on building Chef cookbooks that
can truly claim to be reusable, extensible, and usable by many organizations.
To this end I've built the [Poise](https://github.com/poise/poise) helpers,
the [Halite](https://github.com/poise/halite) workflow tools, and numerous other
libraries to make Chef a little bit more pleasant to work with.

I've also spent a lot of time helping grow the Chef and Python communities. I
provide fairly regular support hours on the #chef IRC channel, as well as
guiding new users on StackOverflow and the Chef mailing list. I also mentor
new developers in the San Francisco Python scene through SFPython and the local
PyLadies chapter. I enjoy [speaking at conferences](/talks/) with a particular
focus on making broad and mildly bespoke topics more accessible to the average
engineer.

# About You

* San Francisco area or remote-friendly (or both).
* Committed to open-source ideals and communities.
* Sustainable work/life balance and professional development.
* Working to correct systemic failures of the industry.

Ideally I would like to find a role that lets me continue building tools and
cookbooks for the Chef community as a whole. Some specific projects I've got in
mind for the future include upgrading cookbook testing tools to support a better
CI workflow, libraries to make it easy to manage secrets and passwords from
Chef, and reducing the barriers to entry for new users. Do you have tricky Chef
challenges when deploying your applications and infrastructure? Let's work
together to build and open-source reusable solutions so we can solve the problem
for you and for everyone else at the same time!

I am located in San Francisco's East Bay with easy access to downtown, and am
also happy to discuss remote work possibilities. At this time I have no plans
to relocate elsewhere.

While not required, organizations with a history of combating the systemic
sexism, racism, and general terribleness of the technology industry will get
brownie points (or maybe actual brownies if you are that awesome). I would
also love to see organizations with [trans-inclusive healthcare](http://microactivism.wikia.com/wiki/Micro-Activism_Wiki),
[equitable pay](https://modelviewculture.com/news/lets-talk-about-pay), [good
maternity and paternity policies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIhKAQX5izw),
and [PTO policies that encourage healthy work/life balance](https://jacobian.org/writing/unlimited-vacation/).

A few deal-breakers for me include a group culture based around alcohol, relying
on unpaid "third shift" labor to replace an HR team, or organizational
restrictions on contributing to open-source projects.
