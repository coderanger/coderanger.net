title: Media I Consume
date: 2016-10-08
---

The world is awash with media, entertainment, and information. I have only a
finite amount of time so I, like everyone, pick and choose what things I consume
to try and maximize the benefit to myself. As the Internet has made long-tail
media ever more available (and more reasonable to produce), I feel like I am
increasingly silo'd by my media choices, and many of the things I love are known
to only a (relatively) small group. I present this list of my current
consumption habits both in the hopes that more people will find the things I
enjoy and that maybe others can do the same and I can find their things.

# The Rules

Taking a cue from Extra Credits' (don't worry, we'll get to them) Games You
Might Not Have Tried series, everything here I find interesting enough to
watch/read/play/listen to regularly but I make no objective (or even subjective
in some cases) claims that things here are good. If you try them out and decide
"not for me" that's cool and we can still be friends. Things are also not in
any specific order; this is not ranked in any way. I've tried to limit this to
things that I come back to over and over, so not just everything I've read or
watched as that would be too much.

# Games

As most of these are multi-player, if you either already play them or just
want to try them out, shoot me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/kantrn) or an
[email](&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#110;&#111;&#x61;&#104;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;)
and maybe we can team up or whatnot.

## Laptop/Desktop

### [Kingdom of Loathing](https://kingdomofloathing.com/)

Starting with the thing that is probably my highest ratio for unknown-ness to
enjoyment. A know a lot of people that would say "wait, that thing with the stick
figures? I totally played that in high school". Well, it's still going strong
after almost 15 years. KoL is a testament to the value of good, systemic game
design, solid humor, and a dev team that feels they can wait and Do Things
Right™ instead of Right Now. More specifically, KoL is a free, web-based RPG
with some light MMO-y aspects like a player economy and chat system. You can
play through a single run in two or three weeks of 30 minute sessions, but
beyond that it has one of the deepest and most balanced new-game-plus systems
I've ever run into. The art style is perhaps an acquired taste, but unlike
most RPGs the text is worth reading and is almost always good for a laugh. Plus
the main currency of the game is meat. An Adventurer Is Me.

Also if web RPGs aren't your thing, they have a "normal" RPG game coming out
early next year: [West of Loathing](http://westofloathing.com/). If you are
looking for a comedic Western RPG, you have very specific tastes but fortunately
your ship has finally arrived.

### [Fallen London](http://fallenlondon.storynexus.com)

Another free, web-based RPG, though with even fewer multi-player elements. The draw
of Fallen London is the writing. It is set in an alternate history where a
mysterious force swallowed up London in the 1800s, transporting it to an
impossibly large cavern where death has taken a vacation, the best wine is
brewed with mushrooms, and Hell is literally next door. It's a mix of
Victorian-ish culture, Cthulhu-y weirdness, and a dash of Girl Genius mad
science.

The same team also made a more desktop-y game called Sunless Sea, and have a
major expansion for it, Zubmariner, and a new game, Sunless Skies, coming out
soon. I bounced off Sunless Sea because of the much slower pacing (to make up
for the lack of a daily energy system) and general confusion about how the
ship battle system worked, but am looking forward to giving it another try with
Zubmariner.

### [Hearthstone](http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/)

One of the more well known things on this list, but I play at least a few games
a week so it still belongs here. I've found I bounced pretty hard off constructed
play because I'm not willing to put in the time to track the ever-evolving
metagame, but the weekly Tavern Brawl is usually fun for a few hours and maybe
some day I'll actually be good at drafting. Free to try, but they are stingy
with the free packs early on so if you want to play constructed formats expect
to drop a few dollars ($5) on the Welcome Bundle.

There is also a mobile client, but the smaller screen makes it hard for me because
I have big hands. Sometimes nice if I get stuck in an airport unexpectedly though.

### [EVE Online](https://www.eveonline.com/)

I've had a long love/laugh cycle with Eve. I keep my accounts subscribed so
they keep training, but I only usually play actively maybe one month out of every 6-9.
That said, they are moving to a full-on free-to-play model soon with the Alpha
Clone system so if you've always heard weird and wonderful stories about
space spreadsheets, maybe give it a try. For those that haven't heard said
stories, EVE Online is an MMORPG about flying spaceships around and basically
doing whatever you want. It's a single, shared world with the majority of
territory controlled by player organizations. Unique amongst most MMOs, scamming
and most forms of griefing are both allowed and usually encouraged. Underneath
the "harden the fuck up" attitude are lots of nice people though, just maybe
don't take it personally when someone ruins your space day.

Also more people should know about the `o7` meme/emoticon/smiley/whatever. It's a little
person saluting. This is useful in many places but people rarely know what the
hell I'm saying. o7o7m8m8.

## Mobile

Heads up that this will be iOS centric because that's what I carry, but most
of these are available for Android too.

### [Marvel Puzzle Quest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marvel-puzzle-quest/id618349779?mt=8)

I was a sucker for the original Puzzle Quest(s) as a kid and it still works on
me today. I also love a lot of Marvel characters, so double yay. It's in the
category of "mobile F2P with microtransactions", but they are pretty reasonable
as these things go. They are also about to start a big anniversary event soon,
so if you have been meaning to try it out, now is a good time to get some free
stuffs. It's pretty standard Puzzle Quest gameplay, big grid of tiles, match 3
(or more for bonuses), matches charge special powers (tied to the Marvel characters
you are using for that mission) with some RPG-ish level up mechanics. It adds
some nice new bits while still keeping the PQ core mechanics at their best.

### [Clash of Clans](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clash-of-clans/id529479190?mt=8)

Okay, so this is probably the first thing on this list that I don't actually
_like_, but continue to interact with regularly. I do this mostly because
Clash of Clans makes an utterly unreal amount of money worldwide and as an
eternal student of systems design I think it is wise to at least keep track of
what they are doing right (or maybe wrong depending on your point of view). I
also periodically stick my head in to their spin-off game [Clash Royale](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/clash-royale/id1053012308?mt=8).

I did a similar thing with another game, [Puzzle and Dragons](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/puzzle-dragons-english/id563474464?mt=8),
which is even more successful but less well known in the US I think. I fell off
that one eventually after seeing what felt like all I could see without giving
them large amounts of money, but it's worth a look at least if you want to know
what, apparently, people like.

### [The Simpsons: Tapped Out](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-simpsons-tapped-out/id497595276?mt=8)

A slightly guilty pleasure, this is a pretty naked "timers and microtransactions"
game. But with Simpsons nostalgia. Most new unlocks give a nice "oh yeah, I remember
that episode, it was funny" moment. So sue me.

### [Blackbox](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/blackbox-think-outside-box/id962969578?mt=8)

Switching things up from the microtransaction-y grinders, Blackbox is a weird
and wonderful puzzle game for iOS. The gimmick is that every puzzle is solved
without touching the screen. It uses all kinds of sensor data I didn't even know
was exposed to apps and can be pretty inscrutable at times, but check it out
anyway.

### [Pokemon GO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-go/id1094591345?mt=8)/[Ingress](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ingress/id576505181?mt=8)

Meh, like many (most?) people I played Ingress a bunch long ago and then a bunch
more Pokemon GO when it came out, and then stopped bothering as I ran out of
things to do. I _really_ hope Niantic steps up their game, until then I'll
probably just pull it out sometimes when I go for a walk after work and be sad
about the squandered potential.

### [Monkey Wrench](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monkey-wrench/id999022137?mt=8)

Word search on a hex grid, where you don't get told what the words are, only
which letters are starting points and the categories. This is on my list of
"chill" things to do when winding down to bed. Simple, but elegant and well made.
The same team has an earlier game, Red Herring, which is kind of related but
felt a lot more unfair as many of the clues relied on specific (British?) pop
culture knowledge to make sense of.

### [Dream Quest](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dream-quest/id870227884?mt=8)

If you thought Kingdom of Loathing's art was weirdly minimalist, Dream Quest goes
even further. At heart it's a dungeon crawl rougelike but fights are determined
by playing a card game, earning new cards and slots as you get deeper in the
dungeon. I think I've only ever reached the bottom once on the normal difficulty
level, but every run brings me back again eventually. I don't usually love
roguelikes because of the feeling that one bad RNG roll can ruin a run, but
Dream Quest is usually pretty careful to let you make choices at each RNG point
(e.g. pick 1 of 2 random rewards) so at least you can keep things on track. There
is a minor progression system to unlock new classes and add cards in to the random
pools, but it doesn't have a huge impact. If someone remade this with even
vaguely better art I think it would be huge, but for now you can still enjoy it.

### [Hungry Cat Picross](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hungry-cat-picross/id737744473?mt=8)

It's picross (numbers around the edge, fill in the right squares), and its cute,
and that's about it. It's a color picross implementation that is pretty well done,
if sometimes a bit awkward to control. Lots of puzzles included and a weekly
challenge for when you get done with those. I never really got in to sudoku or
other algorithmic-y stuff but this one does it for me.

### [Simon Tatham's Puzzle Collection](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/simon-tathams-portable-puzzle/id622220631?mt=8)

I know I said I don't really love algorithmic puzzles, but I still keep this
one around for funsies every now and then. Written by the author of PuTTY, Puzzles
has been ported to just about every platform in existence. It is a collection
of every algorithmic puzzle the author could find and could build a random
generator for. Sudoku, minesweeper, and lots more weird puzzles, and because
they are randomly generated you can tune the size and difficulty levels very
nicely. The iOS port isn't the best I've used, but it gets the job done and is
free. Just remember that any time the docs say "right click", they mean "long
press".

# Video

## [Vlogbrothers](https://youtube.com/user/vlogbrothers) et al

They have millions of subscribers, so this one is probably not exactly in the
"unknown" category but whatevers. Starting way back in the early days of YouTube,
the brothers Hank and John Green have run an ongoing video blog for years. Some
days it's contemplative video essays, other days it's hyperactive editing and
jokes. Never boring and with a YouTube community base that pretty much can't
be beat.

They also have a lot of co-produced YouTube channels which I enjoy, so to save
space I'll just lump them all together. The names are pretty self-explanatory:
[Sexplanations](https://youtube.com/user/sexplanations),
[Animal Wonders](https://youtube.com/user/Anmlwndrs),
[SciShow](https://youtube.com/user/scishow),
[SciShow Space](https://youtube.com/user/scishowspace),
[Healthcare Triage](https://youtube.com/user/thehealthcaretriage) and,
[The Brain Scoop](https://youtube.com/user/thebrainscoop) (okay this one isn't
self explanatory, it's about the Field Museum and the research/collections it has).

## [Crash Course](https://youtube.com/user/crashcourse)

Kind of double-counting here but I think it's important enough to say again.
Crash Course is an ever-growing series of educational videos from the same
team behind a lot of the Vlogbrothers network. They have series on US and world
history, chemistry, literature, philosophy, astronomy, anatomy, and more. Want
to learn a thing? They are consistently high quality, well written, and easy to
understand.

## [Extra Credits](https://youtube.com/user/ExtraCreditz)

Musings on video games, the games industry, and societal trends as they turn
up in the general gaming zeitgeist. Always well thought out and presented, I
highly recommend Extra Credits to all gamers that want to think a little harder
about their hobby, or to game devs that want a good source of Deep Thoughts and
important discussions about our culture.

They also do an excellent history series called Extra History that I highly
recommend. While the Crash Course history shows tried to avoid the specter of
"great person" history education in favor of a more subtle and realistic approach,
Extra History goes full steam ahead with the story-based model. This does sometimes
make things slightly less accurate (they do a Lies video at the end of each
sequence to come clean on all the little bits they fudged) but it gives the
historical events a real feeling of emotional connection that is easy to miss
in the dry, dates-and-places approach many of us grew up with.

## [CGPGray](https://youtube.com/user/CGPGrey)

Gray is hard to describe, but basically he explains things. Usually slightly
weird topics like "What is Holland?" or "Why do we have traffic jams?", but always
fun to watch. Not much to say really other than go subscribe, and then be sad he
only puts out a video every month or two.

## [Numberphile](https://youtube.com/user/numberphile) et al

Collectively (Dr.) Brady Haran has more YouTube channels than should probably be
allowed, but they are mostly things I enjoy so huzzah. Numberphile is, I think,
the biggest channel and focuses on mathematic topics but he also has [Objectivity](https://youtube.com/channel/UCtwKon9qMt5YLVgQt1tvJKg)
exploring the archives of the Royal Society, [Deep Sky Videos](https://youtube.com/user/DeepSkyVideos) for astronomy,
[Sixty Symbols](https://youtube.com/user/sixtysymbols) for physics,
[Periodic Videos](https://youtube.com/user/periodicvideos) for chemistry, and
[Computerphile](https://youtube.com/user/Computerphile) for computer science.
Usually interviews with professors or other experts covering a specific topic.
Between all the channels there is almost always at least one new video every day,
so always something new to see or hear.

## [Vihart](https://youtube.com/user/Vihart)

Vi Hart is somewhere between "explaining complex mathematics" and "interpretive
artist". Musings on life, society, and maths, with an engaging style and art
form to go with it. She has slowed down with videos as (I think) her day job
takes more time and YouTube continues to kind of be a cesspool, but there is
lots of back catalog to enjoy too.

## [Vsauce](https://youtube.com/user/Vsauce)

Michael is the closest I've found to a moder interpretation of James Burke's
Connections series (which maybe I'll write another post on some day because zomg
Connections). He starts from a simple premise like "time goes forward" or "1 + 1
= 2", and then pulls out of that some completely unforeseen complexity like "is
there an infinity plus one? why not?". The quirky nature can put some off, but
I always find the topics to be good for at least a few days of pondering
afterwards.

## [Veritasium](https://youtube.com/user/1veritasium)

Derek makes much more traditional educational videos, usually focusing on science
and physics in particular. He literally wrote a book (his dissertation, but I
say that counts) on how to best use video media to teach science with quantitative
research behind it, so I try to learn from his style even if the content is often
relatively basic (if unintuitive) physics stuffs.

## [Smarter Every Day](https://youtube.com/user/destinws2)

Also in the "famous edu YouTubers" list is Destin. Also a bit on the rare side
because day job, but the raw enthusiasm makes up for it. Topics are all over the
place, but often truly unique like a tour of the ground training model of the
ISS from an astronaut, or showing how combustion works by way of a see-through
potato gun.

## [standupmaths](https://youtube.com/user/standupmaths)

Matt is equal parts mathematician and comedian, and his channel reflects that.
Some videos will explore weird-but-cool shapes, another might be
working out the most square Square in Manhattan. He also has some books on
math humor out if that's your thing, and does live standup shows in the UK
sometimes.

## [Tom Scott](https://youtube.com/user/enyay)

Tom is a vaguely computer-nerd-y video blogger that puts together great videos
at a rate I find impossible to understand given the production values. His
"Things You Might Not Know" and "Amazing Places" series never fail to live up
to their names and he recently got back from an expedition to the arctic with
Chris Hadfield (yes, the astronaut) and has been sharing some amazing footage
and stories from the top of the world.

## [Last Week Tonight](https://youtube.com/user/LastWeekTonight)

With Jon Stewart enjoying a well-deserved retirement and Colbert over on network
television, we've seen a new generation of comedic news shows hit the airwaves.
Of all of them, I think John Oliver is far and away the best. He and his team of
writers have done some seriously hard-hitting investigative journalism and I
almost wish they would slow down so they could dwell on a single story for longer
rather than moving on to a new investigative piece almost every week. If you
have HBO or HBO Go you can watch the full episodes but the usually put the
meaty investigative piece from each week up on YouTube and you should probably
be watching them if only to know exactly how terrible everything is all the time
(but with a funny British accent making it a bit less terrible).

## [SFDebris](http://sfdebris.com/)

Unlike everything else on this just, SFDebris is (mostly) not a YouTube show.
Long ago it was hosted on YouTube but the rate of bogus takedown requests forced
him to relocate to Blip and then to ScreenWave after Disney axed Blip. It is
absolutely worth going to a different site though. His bread-and-butter videos
are comedic reviews of sci-fi TV episodes (originally Star Trek) but he has
branched out over the years to also cover movies, anime, and some games. He
also has a few longer-run series on the history and inside story of things like
the comics industry and the Transformers franchise.

## [Laci Green](https://youtube.com/user/lacigreen)

Along with Sexplanations up above, Laci's Sex+ channel is a great resource for
clear, unbiased, factual sex information, advice, and education. She tends to
focus on more high-impact topics than Dr. Doe, and there are a few I keep
bookmarked for refuting common FUD.

## [ElectroBOOM](https://youtube.com/user/msadaghd)

Before we had math comedy, now we have engineering comedy. He plays it so straight
that I'm only 99% sure he isn't actually doing hilariously unsafe things,
but it's usually good fun. Also A+++ eyebrow game.

## [Practical Engineering](https://youtube.com/user/gradyhillhouse)

One of my more recent follows, but I'm a sucker for infrastructure analysis. He
also does a lot of what I can best describe as "Engineering Let's Play" videos
where he reproduces interesting projects and experiments and records himself.
Definitely looking forward to more "What The Infrastructure" videos.

## [The Engineer Guy](https://youtube.com/user/engineerguyvideo)

Bill Hammack does infrequent but amazingly clear analyses of engineering
problems and lots of common objects. Like examining the complex work that went
in to the click-y pen or the disposable diaper or the aluminum beverage can. He
also recently worked on a version of a famous lecture from Michael Faraday where
he explained basically all of current physics at the time to a lay audience and
it is still better than a lot of my HS physics classes.

## [Kurzgesagt](https://youtube.com/user/Kurzgesagt)

Another in the genre of "thing explainers", this time with wonderful animations
and usually much more in-depth analysis. They tried to rebrand as "In A Nutshell"
at one point because English-speakers couldn't figure out "Kurzgesagt" but I
think they have mustly gone back to the original name. If you've ever looked a
an infographic and thought "that would be cooler with cute animated birds", here
you go.

## [WonderWhy](https://youtube.com/user/WonderWhy7439?)

A more focused "thing explainer", mostly about history and geography and often
the interplay between the two. Videos are more rare, but always great. His
video on [the breakup of Yugoslavia and the ensuing wars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiSgAiM0d8A)
is one of the best summaries of that period I've found.

## [John D Ruddy](https://youtube.com/user/RudtheSpud)

Rapid fire history in an Irish accent, what's not to love? Also a bit on the rare
side, but worth hitting the subscribe button and enjoying the back catalog.

## [No Small Parts](https://youtube.com/user/NoSmallPartsShow)

Amazingly crafted videos exploring the life and work of "you recognize them but
probably don't know their name" character actors like Anne Ramsey, Michael Jeter,
and Pete Postlethwaite. Every episode is clearly made with a great deal of love
and respect for these actors, and gives a bit of insight into the world of the
Hollywood "B list".

## [Every Frame A Painting](https://youtube.com/user/everyframeapainting)

In a similar style to No Small Parts above, Every Frame A Painting looks at the
world of cinematography: how to use form and color and movement to help tell a
story or communicate an emotion. I've always been someone that likes movies and
whatnot, but never really a "movie buff", so this is a whole new world to me
most of the time. I like to think that learning more about video as an art form
helps me make better things, even if just presentation slide decks and CSS code.

## [Major Third](https://youtube.com/user/Major3rdThird)

Unfortunately much rarer on uploads than most of these, Major Third examines
video game music through the lens of formal music theory and critique. Like
with movies, I enjoy music but know almost nothing of the theory and structure
behind it so this has been a nice little look into how Cool Things™ get made.

## [Potholer54](https://youtube.com/user/potholer54)

Debunks of unscientific nonsense, mostly from climate change deniers and
Intelligent Design creationists trying to spin doctrine as science. his videos
have gotten increasingly acerbic over the years, but they are still very well
researched (with citations, as all good science reporting should be) and
generally not picking on people unless they have it coming. He sometimes edges
close to the "militant atheism" aesthetic but usually just on the watchable
side of the line. He has some really great collected series on the evolution of
humans and the overall history of climate change research.

## [You Suck At Cooking](https://youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w)

Absurdist cooking humor. Can't really describe it other than that, just go watch one
episode and you'll know if you like it within about 45 seconds.

## [Ahoy](https://youtube.com/user/XboxAhoy)

Amazingly well crafted looks at gaming topics, mostly the history of specific
games or franchises. He also does retrospective looks at specific weapons, both
their real-world history and their portrayal in games over the years. His five-part
series on the interplay between the history of nuclear weapons and video games
is both the length and quality of a commercial documentary, and should be required
viewing for any student of game design.

## [Melodysheep](https://youtube.com/user/melodysheep)

I could probably put this down in the music section, but the videos along with
each song are usually worth experiencing. Melodysheep uses a mix of autotuning
and sampling to make music out of a variety of video sources. My favorite by
far is the Symphony Of Science. Sagan is already almost music to start with,
but this is a whole different level. If you like this style, also check out
[Pogo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn-K7GIs62ENvdQe6ZZk9-w).

# Podcasts

## [VideoGamesHotDog](http://videogameshotdog.com/)

A podcast on games and life from the crew that works on Kingdom of Loathing plus
the always-excellent Jim Crawford. It's a good place to hear about new indie
games I might want to try, and has a great community. Not having ads is kind
of a breath of fresh air in an increasingly "this episode brought to you by ..."
world, though you should totally contribute to their Patreon and hang out with me
on the VGHD Slack.

The KoL guys (sans Jim) also do a weekly podcast specifically about KoL but unless
you're also playing it (which you totally should) it is probably too niche. The
broader [Hot Dog Network](http://hotdognet.com/) also has Horror Show Hot Dog (which I never listened to
so not 100% sure if it is still running), Advice Hot Dog (defunct advice show),
and Train Hot Dog (part of Jim's ARG for the run up to Frog Fractions 2).

## [Hello Internet](http://www.hellointernet.fm/)

Another "I liked their other work" podcast, this time from CGPGray and (Dr.) Brady
Haran. It isn't really _about_ anything, just two friends talking about whatever
catches their fancy. Usually fun listening though.

Gray also does another podcast called [Cortex](https://www.relay.fm/cortex) but
I bounced off that one.

## [Radiolab](http://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/)

In the dark times before the omnipresent smartphone, I used to get my Radiolab
through NPR on actual radio, but this is much easier. Every episode is something
different, not "investigative reporting" in the cable news sense but they go
and investigate _something_. The invasive goats of the Galapagos, the rise of
paparazzi in Korea, or the history of triage during natural disasters (warning:
that last one hit me like an emotional ton of bricks). It's kind of like a more
approachable version of This American Life.

They also recently did a spin-off miniseries called [More Perfect](https://www.wnyc.org/shows/radiolabmoreperfect)
about 6 important Supreme Court cases from history. I think literally every
person in the US should listen to the whole series. Literally.

## [TED Radio Hour](http://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/)

Another show I used to listen to on actual radio. Each episode they take 3 or 4
TED talks on similar topics and edit them down a bit for radio, and then mix in
some interviews with the speakers to get more details on the theme for the week,
or expand on some bit of the talk. I was sad to see Guy Raz leave All Things Considered
but TED Radio Hour has been good enough to soften the blow.

## [99% Invisible](http://99percentinvisible.org/)

Beautiful. Downtown. Oakland, California. 99PI is kind of like Radiolab's little
brother. It has a similar structure of a new topic every week with some well
researched story from an interesting place or person. It's shorter than Radiolab,
so if you like the idea but don't have the cycles for a 30-45m episode, then
maybe this will be your bag. Or vice versa, if you already like 99PI, you'll
most likely enjoy Radiolab.

## [Welcome To Nightvale](http://www.welcometonightvale.com/)

Another famous one so probably not as many people that haven't heard of it but
for someone, [here you go](https://xkcd.com/1053/). A small-town community radio show
that happens to be set in a town where weird things happen. A lot. Not quite as
dark as a Cthulhu tale but close. It is consistently equal parts funny, weird, and
compelling. You can definitely pick things up in the middle, but there are some
recurring characters and plot arcs so if you like it you might want to brush up
either by listening to the back catalog or the recently-released script books for
seasons one and two.

The same team also recently did a new, unrelated show [Alice Isn't Dead](http://www.nightvalepresents.com/aliceisntdead/) that
I enjoyed and am hoping gets a second season some day.

## [Intelligence Squared](http://www.intelligencesquaredus.org/)

Oxford style debating, one motion, two teams of two, only one side wins.
Some episodes are moving, some thought-provoking, and others just have me yelling
at my computer about how wrong someone is for an hour. This is not cable-news-style
debating where people just say whatever they want, there is a formal structure
with room for responses and discussion. They also don't shy away from touchy
subjects, though often those are the ones that make me (╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻.

## [Robot Congress](http://headgum.com/podcasts/robot-congress/)

A more recent addition, and one I'm more mixed on. It is co-hosted by Ryan Morrison,
better known as The Video Game Attorney, and the high points of the show are
usually the legal analysis of internet and game news/culture. They also sometimes
go off on weird tangents like 10 minutes on why domed cities are the future (they aren't) or
how YouTube Heroes will get early access to Google phones (they won't).

## [Request For Commits](https://changelog.com/rfc/)

Also new but picking up steam fast, a joint venture between Nadia [sp?] and Mikeal
Rogers, they interview (un-ironic) thoughtleaders of the FOSS world about their
experiences. As someone that cares a lot about the culture of open source, this
is basically laser focused on my demographic. Even outside of the value to me
today, I'm also glad to see this bit of our oral history get recorded somewhere
so when we make all the same cultural mistakes in 10 or 20 or 50 years, maybe someone will
remember they can go listen to those that came before.

# Comics

## [Questionable Content](http://questionablecontent.net/)

A heavyweight of the webcomics world. Life, love, sometimes indie music references
I don't understand. It would be hard to pick up in the middle I think, so maybe
decide if you like and then just go back to the start and read from there? I
feel like I've basically grown up around the QC characters so they are part of
the fabric of my universe at this point.

## [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/)

If you don't know what XKCD is, just [click here](https://xkcd.com/1053/). He
said it better than I ever could.

## [SMBC](http://smbc-comics.com/)

Science-y humor, "single panel" comics that go on for pages, and probably more
graphs than normal people find funny. If you like xkcd you'll probably like
SMBC.

The author of SMBC also organizes [BAHFest](http://bahfest.com/), which isn't
related to comics but is too awesome not to mention. A great night of terrible science.

## [Zen Pencils](http://zenpencils.com)

Important, thought provoking, or inspirational quotes set to comics. If I'm
having a bad day, I've got a folder of bookmarks of Zen Pencils pages to go
re-read to try to make the world seem a little less terrible.

## [Girl Genius](http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/comic.php)

Okay, so I don't actually read this right now because I missed a month at one
point like a year ago and now I'm so far behind and need to find a time to binge
and catch up. But I still love it so I'm listing it anyway. Girl Genius is all
the best of Steampunk for me. Alternate history, mad science, monsters and
robots. I basically want to be Agatha Heterodyne when I grow up. If nothing else
I want more people to read Girl Genius so that I can use the word "Spark" and be
understood. I really wish it was available on Comixology, but the whole series
is online and you can get PDFs of the collected books for mobile reading.

## [CHEW](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/chew)

Tony Chu is cibopathic, meaning he gets psychic impressions from anything eats,
how it was raised, prepared, etc. He is also an agent of the FDA, which thanks
to a worldwide avian flu pandemic and subsequent chicken prohibition is now the
worlds most powerful law enforcement agency. It's a weird world full of food-based
superpowers and ridiculous happenings.

## [East of West](https://imagecomics.com/comics/series/east-of-west)

Hard to say much without spoilers but the apocalypse is coming, the Horsemen
were betrayed, and now Death has a score to settle. I love the art style, and
the world feels both alive and yet also clearly dying.

# Music

Most of my music consumption is driven by auto-recommendation algorithms either
in Spotify or Bandcamp. I don't really have much intention behind my consumption
as compared to other areas, but you can always see what I've been listening to
on [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/coderanger).

# Other

## [In The Pipeline](http://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/)

I don't really follow enough blogs directly (i.e. other than seeing friends post
stuff via Twitter) to make this a category but this is one I do try to read
frequently. A mix of drug discovery industry talk and chemistry inside baseball, it's a
good slice of the pharma industry all in one place.

## [SCP Wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net/random:random-scp)

The SCP wiki is basically like crack to me. Like TVTropes level of "just one more
page". I love stories and SCP entries are basically a minimum viable story,
just the nucleus of it so you can read the whole thing in 60 seconds and then
just imagine the broader tale around it. It's a collaborative writing project
so the quality is highly varying but if something is bad it is at least only
a minute or two of bad writing and then you are off to the next entry. The content
is kind of a mix of creepypasta and Warehouse 13, strange and anomalous objects
from all over the world with just a bit of description or back story and not
much else.

## [Reddit](https://reddit.com/)

Sigh, yeah, I still use Reddit. I tried leaning heavier on lobste.rs but it
never really got its hooks in me. If you go through the trouble of unsubscribing
from basically all the default subreddits and replace them with smaller,
less-terrible communities it can be an okay source for news in otherwise niche
spaces. [/r/Georgegifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/Georgegifs/) is my jam.

## [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)

If we were counting by volume, this is probably the majority of the media I
consume. And like with Reddit, sighhhhh. It has gotten a lot better with both
liberal use of the mute button, removing retweets from most people, and making
private lists of people I actually want to see everything from and just skimming
the rest.

## [Imgur](https://imgur.com/new/viral)

The GIFs must flow.

# More?

Know something like one of these that you think I would like? Send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/kantrn)
or an [email](&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#110;&#111;&#x61;&#104;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;)

Also let me know if you end up writing your own version of this, I would love to
link to it. Maybe we can even set up a webring.
