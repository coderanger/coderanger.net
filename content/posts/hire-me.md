As my (mostly) 2016 contract draws to a close, I'm back on the hunt for a new
professional home.

## Who I Am ([Resume](/resume/))

* Toolsmith, teacher, troublemaker.
* Long-time Chef contributor and developer.
* Passionate about open-source, communities, ecosystems, quality.
* Full-stack, from kernel hacking to CSS.

Many of you probably know me as Coderanger. I've been involved in Chef and the
wider operations community for around six years now. I'm also part of the
Python Software Foundation operations team, and some of you may know me through
my role helping with PyCon US. I've been a developer for 9+ years now, across
fields as varied as MMORPG server architecture, mobile security engineering,
front-end design, and operations tooling. I've led teams both for companies and
as a volunteer, coordinating both a front-end development team to build the
new Chef web interface and the volunteer PSF operations group to keep
PyPI, Python.org and other community resources online.

For the last several years my focus has been on building Chef cookbooks that
can truly claim to be reusable, extensible, and usable by many organizations.
To this end I've built the [Poise](https://github.com/poise/poise) helpers,
the [Halite](https://github.com/poise/halite) workflow tools, and numerous other
libraries to make Chef a little bit more pleasant to work with.

I've also spent a lot of time helping grow the Chef and Python communities. I
provide fairly regular support hours on the #chef Slack and IRC channels, as well as
guiding new users on StackOverflow and the Chef mailing list. I also mentor
new developers in the San Francisco Python scene through SFPython and the local
PyLadies chapter. I enjoy [speaking at conferences](/talks/) with a particular
focus on making broad and mildly bespoke topics more accessible to the average
engineer.

## What I'm Looking For

* San Francisco area or remote-friendly (or both).
* Committed to open-source ideals and communities.
* Sustainable work/life balance and professional development.

I'm currently located in San Francisco's East Bay with easy BART access to
both San Francisco proper as well as Oakland and the rest of the BART network.
I've been working either partly or fully remote for much of the last 5 years,
and so am very open to remote positions beyond the Bay Area as well.

## What I'm Interested In

A few of the topics I've been fascinated with lately:

* Secrets management – This one is no secret (_:rimshot:_), I've been giving a
  [talk about the difficulties of infrastructure secrets management](/talks/secrets/)
  at conferences around the world this year. It's a hard problem, but one we
  as a community must embrace if we want to build better systems.
* Interactive agents (aka chatbots) – I've not been as public about this but I
  think a lot of the future of consumer technology is going to be in the evolutionary
  progeny of Siri, Echo, and all the rest. Chatops, home automation, virtual
  assistants, it's all converging on conversational AIs.
* Chef and DevOps tooling – I've been a (very) active member of the Chef community
  for years now, acting as a core maintainer for Chef itself as well as several
  major ecosystem tools, a member of the CBGB Board, and a major community
  cookbook author.
* Python web development – My developer roots are with the Python web world and
  it will always feel like home to me. Despite my recent stint in the world of
  DevOps, I've always said that I'm just a web developer that got lost on his
  way to the deploy script.

I'm open to many things beyond those, but that's the shortlist of the topics
that have been kicking around in my brain for the last 6 months or so.
