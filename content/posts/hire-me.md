Are you a medium-sized company that has been eyeballing the container world,
planning to upgrade your infrastructure around Kubernetes but not entirely
certain how to get from a quick proof-of-concept to a production-grade deployment?
You should <a href="&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#110;&#111;&#x61;&#104;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;">hire me</a>!

Hi there! I'm Noah, also known as Coderanger in some corners of the Internet.
While I've been enjoying my funemployment break, I'm starting to get that
"crawling up the walls" feeling that tells me it's time to look for a new team
to be a part of. You can never know what you don't know so I want to learn about
opportunities and teams from far and wide.

## What I've Done Before

I've been a software engineer for somewhere around 12 years now, and if you
want my employment history you can find it in [my resume](/resume/), but a few
things I think are special:

* Former chair of the [Python Software Foundation Infrastructure team](https://python.org/)
* [PSF Fellow](https://www.python.org/psf/) and [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/) staff-emeritus
* Core maintainer on [Chef](https://github.com/chef/chef) as well as most of [the](https://github.com/chefspec/chefspec) [related](http://www.foodcritic.io/) [ecosystem](https://kitchen.ci/)
* Chef [CBGB oversight board](https://github.com/chef/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc029-governance-policy.md), elected individual representative
* Awesome Chef 2015 award winner
* [Public speaker](/talks/) across three continents

These days my attention is roughly split between the Kubernetes and Chef worlds.
My Chef work is overwhelmingly public so you can take a look at Chef itself or
any of my [Poise family of cookbooks](https://github.com/poise/). On the Kubernetes
side you can check out my guide to using [K8s and Jenkins](/jenkins/) or my guide
to [Kubernetes community resources](/so-you-want-to-k8s/).

Before my days fighting in the "is DevOps even a thing?" wars, I was mostly a
Python web developer. Originally on Trac, and then later with Django. I also had
a brief sojourn as one of the security team at OLPC, we had containers before it
was cool. You can find more details [in my resume](/resume/).

## What I Like Doing

* Building deployment platforms
* Automating processes
* Reducing technical debt
* Working remotely
* Creating the best possible solutions
* Teaching and mentorship
* Public speaking and conference evangelism
* Collaborating with open-source communities

Overall I tend to sell myself as halfway between an internal consultant and an
evangelist. I usually find myself happiest working on internal tools and platforms,
acting as force-multiplier for the productivity of other teams. I find this also
applies in my open-source work, I function best when I can be face-to-face (or
rather keyboard-to-keyboard) with my users, working with them directly to know what
solutions will work best for them.

I'm much more interested in what kind of things I do rather than the kinds of
subjects I work on, but things I am interested in and would love to hear about
opportunities with:

* [Infrastructure automation](https://kubernetes.io/) and [configuration management](https://github.com/chef/chef)
* Open source software and [intellectual property law](/talks/ip/)
* Information security (especially [security automation](/talks/secrets/))
* [Python](https://python.org/) and [Ruby](https://ruby-lang.org/) (I am fluent
  in [many](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) [languages](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  and [functional](https://java.com/) [in](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language))
  [more](http://groovy-lang.org/), but Ruby and Python will always be home)
* Home automation and [conversational AIs](/agents/)
