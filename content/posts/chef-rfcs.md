Chef RFCs are a way to propose and discuss changes to Chef and related projects.

# What is an RFC?

Each RFC proposes a major change to Chef or another piece of software, or to the
processes we use to develop them. Not every change requires an RFC, but for big
changes or those that may affect a large number of people, the RFC process
allows us to discuss and develop them together. Each RFC describes the problem
it is solving, the motivation for the change, a specification of the change, and
a discussion of how this specification was arrived at.

# Who can submit an RFC?

You! Everyone is encouraged to submit RFCs and join the discussion on existing
ones. No CLA or other paperwork is required.

# How do I submit an RFC?

First read over [RFC 0](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc/blob/master/rfc000-rfc-process.md)
which defines the RFC process. In there you can find a template to help you
get started writing your own RFC. Once you have an RFC ready, you can submit it
as a pull request to the [chef-rfc](https://github.com/opscode/chef-rfc)
repository. The community will then discuss your proposal, and if accepted it
will be merged and you can begin your implementation work.

# What does this mean for Open Source Chef?

It means that there is a much more direct way for everyone to have a voice in
shaping the future of Chef as a project. Chef Software still act as stewards of
the project but they have committed to working with the community through this
process and believe, as I do, that it will help build better software for both
the company and community!

# Where can I ask questions about the RFC process?

You can always reach me at [&#110;&#x6f;&#97;&#x68;&#x40;&#x63;&#111;&#100;&#101;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x65;&#114;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;](&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#x74;&#111;&#x3a;&#110;&#111;&#x61;&#104;&#x40;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x64;&#101;&#114;&#x61;&#110;&#103;&#101;&#x72;&#46;&#110;&#x65;&#x74;), I'll be happy to answer any
questions I am able. You can also find me on #chef as `coderanger` or Twitter
as [@kantrn](https://twitter.com/kantrn). This process is still very new and
I welcome any and all help to make it as open and welcoming as possible!
