    Braincrack: (n) an idea you would rather plan about than execute.

<br />

## What

creating the idea. often a given, you have an idea you want to execute on. what if you
don't have an idea? hackathons, game jams.

## Who

Connecting with people that can help. Major trifecta: design, dev, ops. Others,
rubber duck debugging. Safe spaces to fail. Link to vlogbrothers video about Hank.

Nerdfighter comunity and readit1st.

What about non-tech people?

## Where

Two main paths: content -> WP and tumblr, app -> ?. Mobile? Registrar, DNS config,
email maybe (gmail helps here). PaaS vs. non, application flexibility vs. time-to-execute.
Value of free tiers to lubricate the gears of making.

## How

HTML, CSS, Javascript, Objective-C, Java, Django, Rails, Express, Chef, Puppet, Ansible, Fabric, Nagios, Graphite, PagerDuty, Git,
Logstash, NPM, Rubygems, Bunder, Pip, Setuptools, PyPy, Nginx, HAProxy, Apache, Linux,
Docker, Illumos, FPM, Omnibus, ZooKeeper, Subversion, Mercurial, Perl, C, Python, Ruby,
PHP, Go, Scala, Clojure, Postgres, MySQL, Redis, Riak, MongoDB. [start big, get smaller with each line]

App frameworks, config management, mointoring/error logging, All too hard. Years
to learn everything you need to "correctly" launch even a small app. Do it wrong,
but fix the tools.

## When

now, let go of the braincrack.

## Why

making is important. ideas as currency in the modern age. Aside about OLPC, generation
of makers. Building on the shoulders of giants.
